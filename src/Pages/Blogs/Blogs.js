            Difference between javascript and nodejs?

          <p className="text-start py-2">
            <b>Javascript:</b> <br />
            1. A programming language is JavaScript. It works in any browser
            that has a suitable browser engine. <br /> 2. Generally used for any
            client-side activity in a web application, such as possible
            attribute validation or refreshing the page at a set interval, or
            providing some dynamic changes in web pages without refreshing the
            page. <br />
            3. JavaScript running any engine like Spider monkey (FireFox),
            JavaScript Core (Safari), V8 (Google Chrome).
            <br /> <br />
            <b>Nodejs: </b> <br />
            1. It's a JavaScript interpreter and environment with some important
            libraries that JavaScript developers can use individually.
            <br />
            2. It is primarily used for accessing or conducting any non-blocking
            operating system operation, such as writing or executing a shell
            script, getting hardware-specific information, or running any
            backend job.
            <br />
            3. Node JS only run in a V8 engine which mainly used by google
            chrome. And javascript program which will be written under this Node
            JS will be always run in V8 Engine.

            When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb?

            <b>Use Nodejs:</b> <br />
            Any project requires a programming environment and a runtime library
            that can build and/or interpret your code and provides basic
            programming tools and support. Nodejs is a Javascript programming
            language tool. Other languages with similar tools include Python,
            Java, PHP, C#, C++, Go, and others. So, if you want to develop a
            Javascript standalone program or server, you can utilize nodejs.
            <br /> <br />
            <b>Use mongodb:</b> <br />
            If your application requires the capacity to save data so that it
            can be efficiently queried or updated later, you'll almost certainly
            need to use a database. There are numerous well-known databases. One
            such database is MongoDB. Other databases include MariaDB, MySql,
            CouchDB, DynamoDB (on AWS), and Postgres. Distinct databases have
            different strengths (things they excel at) and separate methods of
            being used, therefore picking the right/best database for your needs
            is a completely different topic.

            1. Relational databases are SQL, while non-relational databases are
            NoSQL. <br />
            2. SQL databases have a specified schema and use structured query
            language. For unstructured data, NoSQL databases use dynamic
            schemas. Remote Config <br />
            3. SQL databases scale vertically, but NoSQL databases scale
            horizontally.
            <br />
            4. NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column
            stores, whereas SQL databases are table-based.
            <br />
            5. SQL databases excel in multi-row transactions, while NoSQL excels
            at unstructured data like documents and JSON.
